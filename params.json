  "body": "# About nalgebra\r\n\r\n**nalgebra** is a linear algebra library written for Rust targeting:\r\n\r\n* General-purpose linear algebra (still misses a lot of features…).\r\n* Real time computer graphics (CG).\r\n* Real time computer physics.\r\n\r\nFor more informations and to get help, check out the [online documentation](doc/nalgebra) and the official [user forum](http://users.nphysics.org) (shared with **ncollide** and **nphysics**).\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n\r\n**nalgebra** is meant to be a general-purpose, low-dimensional, linear algebra library, with\r\nan optimized set of tools for computer graphics and physics. Those features include:\r\n\r\n* Vectors with predefined static sizes: `Vec1`, to `Vec6`.\r\n* Vector with a user-defined static size: `VecN` (available only with the `generic_sizes` feature).\r\n* Points with static sizes: `Pnt1`, `Pnt2`, `Pnt3`, `Pnt4`, `Pnt5`, `Pnt6`.\r\n* Square matrices with static sizes: `Mat1`, `Mat2`, `Mat3`, `Mat4`, `Mat5`, `Mat6 `.\r\n* Rotation matrices: `Rot2`, `Rot3`\r\n* Quaternions: `Quat`, `UnitQuat`.\r\n* Isometries (translation ⨯ rotation): `Iso2`, `Iso3`\r\n* Similarity transformations : `Sim2`, `Sim3`.\r\n* 3D projections for CG: `Persp3`, `PerspMat3`, `Ortho3`, `OrthoMat3`.\r\n* Dynamically sized heap-allocated vector: `DVec`.\r\n* Dynamically sized stack-allocated vectors: `DVec1` to `DVec6`.\r\n* Dynamically sized heap-allocated matrix: `DMat`.\r\n* Linear algebra and data analysis operators: `Cov`, `Mean`, `qr`, `cholesky`.\r\n* Almost one trait per functionality: useful for generic programming.",
